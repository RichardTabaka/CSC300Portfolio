# CSC300Portfolio
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The purpose of this cousre was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures and algorithms available.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
     We did so by creating and analyzing the performance of each. It's important to be knowledgeable on many data structures as there is no perfect one-size-fits-all solution that is the best everywhere.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    Whenever I struggled to find a solution to a problem I would consult the internet. My primary resources were Geeks For Geeks, StackOverflow and W3Schools.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    The work I completed on these projects opened my eyes to how and why I would use these data structures using real examples.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The work I completed in this course has reinforced the importance of good, readable code with comments and consistent naming conventions. As for adaptablitiy, some of the assignments allowed for more generic methods to be written that were compatible with multiple data structures.
